# Welcome to My Open Source AI Hub

Welcome to my GitHub account dedicated to **open source software** and the **democratization of AI access** around the globe via Singularity Research Labs (a collection of the brightest minds across the world including ex-Google, Harvard, MIT, Cambridge etc.). I've put repositories on here that I have been working on over the last 2+ years.

### About Me

- **Name:** Sahibzada A.
- **Alma Mater:** Cambridge University 

I am passionate about ensuring that **cutting-edge AI** is accessible to everyone, including underprivileged communities. My repositories here are the culmination of the last two years of research, development, and collaboration.

I achieved the highest score in the world theoretical physics entrance exam (100% raw score on GRE Physics). 

I studied theoretical physics at the University of Cambridge.
